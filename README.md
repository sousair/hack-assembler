# Hack Assembler

### Introduction
This project is an implementation of the Hack Assembler, as suggested in Chapter 6 of the book [The Elements of Computing Systems](https://nand2tetris.org). The assembler is designed to convert assembly code written in the Hack Assembly language into binary machine code that can be executed on the Hack computer architecture.

## Usage
To assemble your Hack Assembly code, follow these steps:

1. Build the assembler:
   ```bash
   $ make
   ```

2. Run the assembler on your input Hack Assembly code file (e.g., input.asm):
   ```bash
   $ ./bin/main input.asm
   ```

## Additional Resources
